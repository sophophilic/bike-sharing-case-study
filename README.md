# Bike Sharing Case Study
##### Background:
* A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.
* Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it.
* This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

##### Company Info
* __Boom Bike__ wants to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.
* They want to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around.
* By doing this, they want to stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

##### High Level Requirements
* Boom Bikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
* The company wants to know the following -
    * Significant Variables in Predicting demand of shared bikes
    * How well these significant variables describe the demands of the bike

##### Business Goal (Objectives)
* Create a model to predict the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
* To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* To know the accuracy of the model i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands


##### Why is this needed ?
* The model should help understand how the demand vary with features.
* This should then allow the management to meet the demand levels and meet customer's expectations
* This model will also help to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
